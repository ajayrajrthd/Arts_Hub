Abstract

We were just trying to get a digital board to work on, another friend of ours was
searching for 8-bit image drawing website/app, but was unable to get a user-
friendly website. So, an idea struck in our mind, that was Art’s Hub.
We wished to make a site wherein you can add filter on images, have a canvas
to work on, have other features like 8-bit drawing and information tab.
What’s different about our site? It’s completely user friendly, no complex tabs,
a simple soothing interface, fit for all, kids to adults. Making features easily
available without requirement of login and registration, without any malware or
virus. Just an easy 2-3 click access.
This site is actually meant for artists, but others can access too.
After speaking with few artist friends, they did like the idea.
Many of the artists mentioned that it’s hard to get reference image and canvas at
the same site, with an easy access.
We aim to provide a user-friendly website to all the artists out there.
We have formed an easy interactive interface for the user, providing all the fun/
required tools and tabs for user. We have clipped many different types of
platforms for drawings which are hardly ever present in any art website
altogether. It has 8-bit drawing tab, a tab for canvas with customisable tool size
and colour, a tab for filtering images (user can add any image present in their
respective device), a tab for getting desired reference image (selecting the
combination you want), a tab providing information on arts/drawing.

Have a look on scope of the project:-

The website provides reference images for kids to adults. All age groups.

The site also provides various sections for image references. Eg. Scenery,
Human Body Figures, Hands and Feet’s, Facial Expressions, Animals and
Birds.

The website provides a classic digital whiteboard. [Adjustable tool size, colour palette].
The website also provides few information about art related stuffs (in
general).

And Filters for Images added/present. User friendly website.

Our project is based on a web application. So,
we have selected 3 languages keeping front-end work in mind.
They are: HTML, CSS & Java Script.
HTML is a language that is used to just put the elements that we want in our web
page without keeping in mind the design or presentation of that particular
element. So, in order to design and beautify our web page, we use style kits like
CSS and JS, through which we can take our website presentation to some
different level. But also, in order to execute this code, we need an IDE (integrated
development environment). So, for this purpose we have used VsCode. Here
various extensions are available to make our execution and debugging very much
easy and quick. To display the output of our code, we have used Google Chrome
as the default web browser.
